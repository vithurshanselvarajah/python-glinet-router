# Modem API Coverage

This page summarizes the GL.iNet SDK 4.0 modem API behavior wrapped by the
`glinet` package. The library supports both the firmware 4.8 aggregate modem
API and the firmware 4.9+ per-slot modem API.

The modem API uses the same JSON-RPC `/rpc` structure as the rest of the router API:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "call",
  "params": ["<sid>", "modem", "<function>", { "...": "..." }],
  "id": 1
}
```

## Read APIs Used

### Firmware 4.8.x

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `modem/get_info` | Lists modem hardware, bus identifiers, ports, SIM data, SMS support, IMEI, modem name/version/vendor. |
| `modem/get_status` | Lists modem status, current SIM, SIM registration, carrier, signal, network state, IP data, traffic counters, unread SMS count. |
| `modem/get_sms_list` | Lists SMS messages with identifier, phone number, text, and timestamp. |
| `modem/get_traffic_config` | Reads the per-SIM cumulative traffic counters and (optional) data-limit configuration. The 4.8 response uses flat keys: `sim{slot}_traffic_total` and `sim{slot}_limit` (`enable`, `threshold`, `unit`, `reset_period`, `day`, `hour`, `month`). |

### Firmware 4.9+

Firmware 4.9 changes the modem read model from aggregate `get_info` / `get_status`
responses to slot-focused endpoints. The integration detects firmware `4.9.0` and
newer from `system/get_info` and normalizes the new responses back into the existing
`{"modems": [...]}` shape used by the sensors.

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `modem/get_modem_current_interface` | Discovers active modem interface names. The integration maps names such as `modem_0001_s1` to `bus: "0001", slot: 1`. On the user's 4.9 router the response carries one entry per active SIM slot (e.g. `modem_0001_s1`, `modem_0001_s2`). |
| `modem/get_signals` | Reads per-slot signal values such as RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, strength, and network type. The integration issues one bodyless call per refresh and indexes the response by slot. |
| `modem/get_network_status` (bodyless) | Reads per-slot dial status, ICCID, protocol, and traffic counters. The 4.9 firmware exposes this as a **bodyless** call — the response carries a `networks` array with one entry per active slot. |
| `modem/get_network_info` (bodyless) | Reads per-slot IP address data (IPv4/IPv6 lease, gateway, DNS), network interface name, and cell information (band, mode, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR). The 4.9 firmware exposes this as a **bodyless** call — the response carries a `networks` array with one entry per active slot. |
| `modem/get_sim_config` | Reads the per-SIM APN and configuration. The 4.9 firmware exposes this as a **per-bus** call — the integration issues one call per distinct modem bus and merges the ICCID-keyed APN onto each modem's `simcard` record. |
| `modem/get_sms_list` | Lists SMS messages. On 4.9+ the integration calls this once per discovered bus. |
| `modem/get_traffic_config` | Reads the per-SIM cumulative traffic counters and (optional) data-limit configuration. The 4.9 response shape uses two arrays: `traffic[].{slot, type, traffic_total}` for the per-SIM traffic totals and `limit[].{slot, type, enable, threshold, unit, reset_period, day, hour, month}` for the per-SIM data limit. The integration sends the bus taken from the discovered modem record (e.g. `"0001"` for `modem_0001_s1` / `modem_0001_s2`); the literal `"cpu"` is only used as a placeholder when the firmware returns no per-slot interfaces. |

#### Bodyless request shape (4.9+)

The 4.9 bodyless calls have **empty params** and return every active network in a
single response. Example for `modem/get_network_info`:

```json
{
  "method": "call",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "params": ["<sid>", "modem", "get_network_info", {}],
  "id": 0
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "ret": 0,
    "resp": "Success",
    "networks": [
      {
        "network_interface": "modem_0001_s1",
        "bus": "0001:01:00.0",
        "slot": "1",
        "ipv4": {
          "ip": "10.77.58.41",
          "gateway": "10.77.58.42",
          "netmask": "255.255.255.252",
          "dns": ["188.31.250.128", "188.31.250.129"]
        },
        "cell_info": {
          "mode": "NR5G-NSA",
          "band": 78,
          "rsrp": "-86",
          "rsrq": "-10",
          "sinr": "22"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The integration indexes the bodyless response by `(bus, slot)` and tries every bus
alias for each target so the short logical bus (`0001`) and the full PCI bus
(`0001:01:00.0`) both resolve to the same modem record. If the bodyless response
returns no entries for a given target, the integration falls back to the per-target
request shape (`{"bus": ..., "slot": ...}`) so older 4.9 builds that haven't
flipped the endpoint still work.

#### Per-bus SIM config (4.9+)

The 4.9 firmware exposes the APN through a separate per-bus call:

```json
{
  "method": "call",
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "params": ["<sid>", "modem", "get_sim_config", {"bus": "0001:01:00.0"}],
  "id": 0
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "8944200204977051694F": {
      "manual": true,
      "username": "",
      "pincode": "",
      "ip_type": 1,
      "cid": 1,
      "roaming": false,
      "apn": "mob.asm.net",
      "password": "",
      "auth": "NONE"
    }
  }
}
```

The response is keyed by ICCID. The integration picks the record whose ICCID matches
the modem's ICCID (falling back to the first record) and copies the `apn` (plus
other SIM fields when present) onto the modem's `simcard` so the `Cellular APN`
sensor continues to resolve the value.

## Write APIs Used

| API | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `modem/send_sms` | Sends SMS using modem `bus`, `phone_number`, `body`, and `timeout`. On 4.9+ the integration includes `slot` when one was discovered. |
| `modem/remove_sms` | Deletes SMS. The integration uses `scope: 10` with the message `name` for a single-message delete and includes `slot` on 4.9+ when known. |

## SMS Error Codes

Most modem APIs require `bus`; firmware 4.9+ may also require `slot`. The integration
selects a default modem by:

1. Prefer a modem from `modem/get_info` with `sms_support: true`.
2. Otherwise prefer a modem with SIM card data.
3. Otherwise use the first modem returned by the router.

On firmware 4.9+, multiple logical modem records can share the same `bus`, so modem
records are keyed internally by `bus` plus `slot`. The public Home Assistant data still
exposes `default_bus` for compatibility and also includes `default_slot` when available.

## Firmware Compatibility Notes

- Firmware 4.8.x keeps using the original aggregate endpoints and sends the same SMS
  payloads as before.
- Firmware 4.9+ uses the new per-slot read endpoints and normalized output. Existing
  cellular sensors continue to read signal, network type, and IP data from the same
  Home Assistant attributes.
- If an individual 4.9 bus/slot probe reports that no modem exists, the integration skips
  that slot and continues polling the remaining discovered slots.

## APIs Not Exposed

The modem PDF also documents mutating APIs for reconnecting, auto-connect, SIM config, tower locking, traffic limits, firmware upgrade, and SIM unlock. Those are not exposed yet because they can disrupt router connectivity or require more UI/confirmation work.
